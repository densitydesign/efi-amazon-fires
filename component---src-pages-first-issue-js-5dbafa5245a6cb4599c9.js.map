Panelaco is a form of protest which was originally used against the former Dilma government and was later taken over by the protestors against Bolsonaro. The social media influencer’s account tweeted calling for a balcony protest by banging pots and pans at their window using a photo of the former president Dilma holding a pan and sharing a video of panelaço in Rio de Janeiro. One of these tweets was also shared by the Brazilian Labour Party Senator Humberto Costa and the former Health Minister.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"col-3 offset-2 mt-n5\">\n              {/* <Image classi=\" \" src={img64} /> */}\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"row py-5\">\n          <div className=\"row mb-n5\">\n            <div className=\"col-lg-5 col-10 offset-1\">\n              <Heading3 classi=\"pb-3\" text=\"While not as prominent as those against him, voices supporting Bolsonaro were also present\" />\n              <p>\n                When zooming into pro-Bolsonaro hashtags it is possible to identify tweets from pro-Bolsonaro accounts, many of which are suspended on Twitter.

The article criticised the news from the mainstream media as “fake news” and twisted the narrative to portray alternative ways to interpret the scientific insights.
