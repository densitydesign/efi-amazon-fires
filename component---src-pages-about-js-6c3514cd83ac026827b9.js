While the Amazon rainforest fires became an international issue in 2019, far fewer debates and news stories have emerged in 2020 despite the situation becoming worse. In 2020, not only did the number of fires show a 61% rise in September compared to the same month in the previous year, but the Pantanal wetlands in Brazil also faced a record high number of fires. The fires in the Amazon are reported to have a strong link with deforestation driven by the global agricultural commodity trade. As the forest loss has significant impacts on soil moisture, the dry land is amplifying the severity of the fires every year. Therefore, the Amazon rainforest fires are not just a single event that happened in the past.

Following the annual deforestation data release by INPE, the National Institute for Space Research in Brazil, the Bolsonaro government dismissed Ricardo Magnus Osório Galvão as the INPE’s director on 3 August 2019. The event was followed by the Day of Fire’ (Dia do Fogo) on 10-11 August 2019 which many referred to as an event confidentially planned and illegally organised by the local ranchers and landowners for ‘slash-and-burn’ of the publicly owned forests in the state of Para. The 2019 Amazon rainforest fires were also surrounded by a number of political controversies. As Bolsonaro has widely supported agricultural businesses and industries such as cattle ranching and soybean farming, there was already growing criticism towards the government within Brazil before the fires made it to the international media. In addition, Macron among other politicians responded on social media calling for a discussion of international aid at the G7 meeting.

Yet, those who have been following the deforestation issues closely and others following political matters indicated the growing difficulties in carrying out their journalistic work in Brazil, due to the limited access and the abundance of false and unverified information provided by the government. According to the consulted journalists, international media also widely reported the event, sending a number of reporters to Brazil and the affected area. While the international media sparked national interests on the issue even further, some were conducting 'parachute journalism' without the background, context nor local contacts.
