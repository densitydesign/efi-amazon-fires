              When looking at the role of science in online engagement around the 2019 Amazon rainforest fires, we can see multiple ways where science and scientific perspectives were mobilised. For example, it is possible to observe specific scientific voices receiving a significant amount of visibility on social media and media articles.

            <p className="py-2 serif">
              Yet, in many instances especially on social media, scientific voices were almost absent, marginal, present at the periphery or only after the ‚Äúpeak‚Äù.
